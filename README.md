# A Low-Complexity Radar Detector Outperforming OS-CFAR for Indoor Drone Obstacle Avoidance
This repository contains an example code comparing our proposed detector to OS-CFAR, a video showcasing the reduced computational complexity of our system compared to standard detection schemes and a video showing our proposed detector working on-line on a drone.

## Example code

Please check-out the example code and dataset provided in this repository. It provides a Python implementation of our proposed detector and of OS-CFAR. By running the code, the Receiver Operating Curves (ROC) of our proposed detector and OS-CFAR showing the probability of detection vs. the probability of false alarm are computed and shown. 

## Compared to standard 2D CA-CFAR and clutter removal
